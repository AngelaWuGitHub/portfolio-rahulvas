Abstract of Cryptocurrency With the World This project aims to utilize social media and other various news outlets to predict spikes and troughs of the cryptocurrency market. This data is aggregated together via various APIs and analyzed. The analysis is then conveyed to a user via text or email and a user can execute a trade via text or email. Eventually, the aim is to produce a bot to auto-trade cryptocurrencies. Abstract of Drone Monitoring Crime happens everyday and sometimes, officers respond too slowly due to a number of conditions. In this case, drones will allow officers to reach the scene of a crime before they physically arrive. Officers can pursue suspects, gather information, and survey the scene quicker and more efficiently than otherwise possible. Drones can then feed data back to the officer so they can analyze distance, images, and other key elements that could help solve a crime.

["Crypto-trading-Bot.html", "1 Cryptocurrency Trading with the World 1.1 The State of Cryptocurrency. 1.2 A Plan to Make Money. 1.3 Final Thoughts.", " 1 Cryptocurrency Trading with the World Keywords cryptocurrency, trading, investing, bitcoin, python, machine-learning, ai, datascience, tradingbot, nlp, scikit 1.1 The State of Cryptocurrency. In the last two months of 2017, the cryptocurrency market went beserk. As families got together for the Thanksgiving holiday, the word about Bitcoin’s rapid growth spread around and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action. People began tweeting about cryptocurrencies, new podcasts began to spring up, and even media outlets started to report on the insane growth. These internet currencies rose at an almost exponential rate due to a new factor: word of mouth. Word of mouth can be used to see the general consesus of a particular cryptocurrency and then further used to make decisions (buy or sell). Additionally, this information can lead to an information cascade that can either beneficial or harmful (if bad theories are spread) to users. If users can sift through the noise and the false news, they may be able to make a sizeable gain in their investment. Furthermore, this information might be able to help students secure enough capital to pay off loans (or buy Lamborghinis). (Katz 2018) 1.2 A Plan to Make Money. 1.2.0.1 Overview In order to utilize the word of mouth idea, we will need to collect a lot of data, not just about coins, but also about what people are saying about certain coins. Fortunately, a lot of this data is widely available online. 1.2.0.2 The Process In order to ensure that we are getting the best data possible, we have to utilize various APIs to get data. Ideally we’ll need data from three sources: Price data Sentiment data News data We can get price data from several websites; however, there are certain sites that will allow us to get information for a lot of coins at the once. The first and perhaps best site to get information from is CoinMarketCap. They have an excellent API that will allow us to get the price of the Top 100 cryptocurrencies every minute (perhaps even more frequent; however, we don’t want to abuse their API). This will give us a nice tabular dataset with a time stamp and the price of a coin at the given time. We can also use exchange level data from various crypto exchanges; however, I believe CoinMarketCap will suffice. The next dataset that we will need is sentiment data. The best one I can think of is Twitter’s free API which allows a user to download the most popular tweets for a specific topic. We will be able to count the number of distinct tweets made about a particular cryptocurrency in order to capture any spikes in “voice” for a particular currency. Furthermore, there are free Natural Language Processing sentiment packages available that can be used on each tweet to determine whether someone is saying something positive or negative about a coin. If we can gather a spike of positive sentiment, it may be a directive to take a deeper look at this coin. Additionally, there is also a possibility of using Google Trends data in order to get query volume. We may be able to see a spike in the Trend numbers correlate with the raw tweet count pulled from Twitter. The final (for now) dataset that we will need is news data. There are APIs for the New York Times and other magazine and news sites that can be used to pull more data about coins. Google News also has an API available so stories from various sites can be pulled. CNBC did a segment on their channel a few weeks ago showing users how to buy the coin Ripple (XRP) and thus the price of Ripple skyrocketed within a few hours of that segment. Pulling this information in real time and then immediately acting on the surge of information will allow the user to react quicker than the general population. Each week there is a new partnership between a certain cryptocurrency and a Fortune 500 company or a large offshore bank. By monitoring the news sites for relevant coin information, users will be able to make informed decisions of coin price spikes or falls. Additionally, searching articles for specific words like “theft”, “regulation”, and “bubble” can sway the sentiment and will also play an important role on the price of a coin. (Haselton 2018) 1.2.0.3 The Outcome Ideally, a bot will be created in order to actually perform the buying and selling in real time; however, I believe that a user can be in charge of this action. An alert could be sent to a user’s phone, giving them a brief description and an option for a choice. The user is can respond with Yes or No and thus the bot can perform the action, allowing a user to trade from anywhere. If the user does not respond, the bot would go ahead and act upon the action (essentially, choosing Yes on its own). 1.3 Final Thoughts. This idea is actually inspired by Planet Money’s Trump Bot. The hosts of the show noticed a correlation between President Trump’s tweets mentioning a certain company and that company’s stock price. This idea is essentially taking that one step further by using the population as a whole in order to help guess the price of a coin. Users should take note, this is real investing with real money. There is no guarentee that this will work and the potential downside is losing the principal amount that was put in. Furthermore, while there are huge gains currently in the crypto-space, there is a large consesus that this is a bubble that is about to pop. Users should be prepared to lose everything they put in because with high reward comes high risk. (Goldmark 2018) Furthermore, I believe that a bot is just the beginning of this idea. I truly think that we can use the data collected in order to predict the cryptocurrency market. I believe that we will be able to find trends that will signify a coin’s potential rise (and fall) a few hours before a spike or trough occurs. Bibliography "],
["Drone-Monitoring.html", "2 Drones for Safety 2.1 We’re being watched. Crime still happens. 2.2 It’s a Bird! It’s a Plane! … It’s a Drone? 2.3 A Safer World.", " 2 Drones for Safety Keywords Drones, Image Recognition, Machine Learning, AI, Law Enforcment Police Drone Image 2.1 We’re being watched. Crime still happens. When a crime occurs, police are called immediately. Unfortunately, traffic and distance can affect how quickly an officer is able to be at the scene of a crime. While major crimes may be attended to faster, smaller crimes like roberries, hit and runs, and drunk drivers are usually hard for officers to get to right away. In Los Angeles, for the month of January 2018, there were 2 wanted murder suspects, 3 hit and runs, and 5 robberies. In Los Angeles, for non serious threats, officers arrived on the scene of a crime approximately 10 minutes after the crime was reported, which while not horrible, still has a significant lag time. Admitedly, Los Angeles is a big city and there is a lot of crime associated with a big city; however, there are not enough officers to help catch these smaller crimes. In New Orleans, it took 17 minutes for an officer to arrive on the scene after an armed robbery took place. In Dallas, police take an average of 22 minutes to arrive for non-emergencies. Drones can solve this problem. With drones specifically made for a police department’s use case, drones can help officers when time is of the essence. [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/16/local/me-lapd16] [http://www.lapdonline.org/january_2018] 2.2 It’s a Bird! It’s a Plane! … It’s a Drone? 2.2.1 A Few Scenarios If a crime is reported, the dispatcher usually records all the necessary information needed for an officer to be at the scene of the crime. According to the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, when a crime is reported, officers usually try to get: Descriptions of anyone involved. Descriptions or names of any witnesses. License plate number of any vehicles (even if they were not involved). Descriptions of stolen property. (???) These items are very visual and people who are either in shock or upset have to do their best to describe them to an officer or wait for an officer to arrive on the scene of a crime. If the dispatcher can send a drone out to the location of the crime, the drone can fly above buildings (perhaps not skyscrapers), in order to reach the location of the crime faster than a police vehicle. Additionally, the drone can provide a live feed of the situation to the police station that the officers can view in the car. Furthermore, if the subject is a hit and run or a drunk driver, the drone can be fed the license plate of the car, and it can find and follow the car, giving real time location data to the police officers. According to USA Today, in 2011 there were 32,367 fatal hit and runs. Drones have the possibility of being at the scene of the crime within minutes and can immediately start recording video and provide GPS coordinates to police officers. With this ability, people will be able to truly have safer streets because drunk drivers no longer can get away from the law. (???) The data that the drones will provide will allow officers to have better statistics on crime occurrence as well as closed cases. Since the GPS coordinates of these drones will be tracked by the police agency itself, police will be able to see faster more optimized routes via their internal GPS system. Overall, police departments could benefit from the use of drones to aid in their work. Realistically, drones will help officers follow suspects, observe crimes from a distance, and help in pursuits. There is also the added benefit of safety. An officer can control a drone without directly putting their life in danger. 2.2.2 What is being done Currently the most common type of drone used is the unmanned ground drone. While these aren’t the flight based drones, these machines help officers deal with potential hazards for inspection and disarming. I believe that these unmanned ground drones (UGD) will help ease the entry for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The UGDs have been very successful track record in help preventing harm from befalling officers, and thus I suspect officers would also be open to UAV aid. In France, police officers are using drones to identify dangerous drivers. An officer monitors the camera of the drone and looks out for any suspect vehicles, and they then convey this information to the officer that is nearest to the scene. In the case of traffic violations for trucks, they have the ability to stop 15 to 20 trucks in an hour. According to Marketplace, the government intends to purchase more drones in order to bring similar traffic surveillance operations to other parts of the country. (???) Los Angeles had wildfires plague the city during the last two months of 2017. In order to help identify potential hotspots for fire activity, the Los Angeles Fire Department used UAVs to assist them. The fire department stated that the drones were much cheaper to operate than to wait for a helicopter and crew to get ready. They plan on using drones to help search for “missing hikers, assess hazardous materials incidents, and provide an extra vantage point for swift-water rescues.” (???) Due to the success of these drones, Bard College published a dataset on drone (both UGV and UAV) adoption and below, can show the adoption of drones (how many were transferred to the department and how many units the department has total): Bard College In terms of technology and data, many drone companies offer APIs which allow for air traffic control and flight paths. Popular UAV manufacter DJI has a flight control API that allows for monitor control, taking off and landing, and “missions”. These features could be utilized for automating patrolling of an area. Furthermore, the Flight Controller API allows for altitude, position, and speed data collection. (???) 2.3 A Safer World. Drones will allow for police to be at locations quicker and have more visibility to crimes shortly after they occur. They will also allow more petty crime to be solved and for justice to be served. There is already evidence that they are helping with reduce crime and prevent accidents. I believe that regulated adoption of drones by police officers can have a big impact on crime reduction. It should also be noted that drones are not a subsitute for real people. There needs to be some emotional component to any officer victim relationship and a drone cannot replace that relationship. There is an ethical dilemma of how much more can we be watched and who has access to these feeds. The public is already weary of being monitored by the government, they will not take kindly to be monitored even more. All over the country there are legal battles over the legalization of drone use by law enforcement officers, mainly due to privacy concerns. In response to this, I would argue that drones can also help monitor police officer activity and help stop any abuse of power by law enforcment officials. The system isn’t perfect; however, I strongly believe that drones can help aid in crime reduction. "],
