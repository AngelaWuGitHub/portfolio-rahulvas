<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The State of Cryptocurrency.</h2>
<p>In the last two months of 2017, the cryptocurrency market went beserk. As families got together for the Thanksgiving holiday, the word about Bitcoin’s rapid growth spread around and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action. People began tweeting about cryptocurrencies, new podcasts began to spring up, and even media outlets started to report on the insane growth. These internet currencies rose at an almost exponential rate due to a new factor: <em>word of mouth</em>. Word of mouth can be used to see the general consesus of a particular cryptocurrency and then further used to make decisions (buy or sell). Additionally, this information can lead to an information cascade that can either beneficial or harmful (if bad theories are spread) to users. If users can sift through the noise and the false news, they may be able to make a sizeable gain in their investment. Furthermore, this information might be able to help students secure enough capital to pay off loans (or buy <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-4chan-user-bought-a-200000-lamborghini-using-bitcoin-2013-12">Lamborghinis</a>). <span class="citation">(Katz <a href="#ref-katz_number_nodate">2018</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> A Plan to Make Money.</h2>
<div id="overview" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.0.1</span> Overview</h4>
<p>In order to utilize the word of mouth idea, we will need to collect a lot of data, not just about coins, but also about what people are saying about certain coins. Fortunately, a lot of this data is widely available online.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-process" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.0.2</span> The Process</h4>
<p>In order to ensure that we are getting the best data possible, we have to utilize various APIs to get data. Ideally we’ll need data from three sources:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Price data</li>
<li>Sentiment data</li>
<li>News data</li>
</ol>
<p>We can get price data from several websites; however, there are certain sites that will allow us to get information for a lot of coins at the once. The first and perhaps best site to get information from is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>. They have an excellent API that will allow us to get the price of the Top 100 cryptocurrencies every minute (perhaps even more frequent; however, we don’t want to abuse their API). This will give us a nice tabular dataset with a time stamp and the price of a coin at the given time. We can also use exchange level data from various crypto exchanges; however, I believe CoinMarketCap will suffice.</p>
<p>The next dataset that we will need is sentiment data. The best one I can think of is <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview">Twitter’s free API</a> which allows a user to download the most popular tweets for a specific topic. We will be able to count the number of distinct tweets made about a particular cryptocurrency in order to capture any spikes in “voice” for a particular currency. Furthermore, there are <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html">free Natural Language Processing sentiment packages</a> available that can be used on each tweet to determine whether someone is saying something positive or negative about a coin. If we can gather a spike of positive sentiment, it may be a directive to take a deeper look at this coin. Additionally, there is also a possibility of using Google Trends data in order to get query volume. We may be able to see a spike in the Trend numbers correlate with the raw tweet count pulled from Twitter.</p>
<p>The final (for now) dataset that we will need is news data. There are APIs for the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> and other magazine and news sites that can be used to pull more data about coins. Google News also has an <a href="https://newsapi.org/s/google-news-api">API</a> available so stories from various sites can be pulled. CNBC did a segment on their channel a few weeks ago showing users how to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/02/how-to-buy-ripple.html">buy the coin Ripple (XRP)</a> and thus the price of Ripple skyrocketed within a few hours of that segment. Pulling this information in real time and then immediately acting on the surge of information will allow the user to react quicker than the general population. Each week there is a new partnership between a certain cryptocurrency and a Fortune 500 company or a large offshore bank. By monitoring the news sites for relevant coin information, users will be able to make informed decisions of coin price spikes or falls. Additionally, searching articles for specific words like “theft”, “regulation”, and “bubble” can sway the sentiment and will also play an important role on the price of a coin. <span class="citation">(Haselton <a href="#ref-haselton_how_2018">2018</a>)</span></p>

<div id="the-outcome" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.0.3</span> The Outcome</h4>
<p>Ideally, a bot will be created in order to actually perform the buying and selling in real time; however, I believe that a user can be in charge of this action. An alert could be sent to a user’s phone, giving them a brief description and an option for a choice. The user is can respond with <code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code> and thus the bot can perform the action, allowing a user to trade from anywhere. If the user does not respond, the bot would go ahead and act upon the action (essentially, choosing <code>Yes</code> on its own).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Final Thoughts.</h2>
<p>This idea is actually inspired by <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/04/07/522897876/meet-botus-planet-money-s-stock-trading-twitter-bot">Planet Money’s Trump Bot</a>. The hosts of the show noticed a correlation between President Trump’s tweets mentioning a certain company and that company’s stock price. This idea is essentially taking that one step further by using the population as a whole in order to help guess the price of a coin. Users should take note, this is <strong>real</strong> investing with <strong>real</strong> money. There is no guarentee that this will work and the potential downside is losing the principal amount that was put in. Furthermore, while there are huge gains currently in the crypto-space, there is a large consesus that this is a bubble that is about to pop. Users should be prepared to lose everything they put in because with high reward comes high risk. <span class="citation">(Goldmark <a href="#ref-goldmark_episode_nodate">2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe that a bot is just the beginning of this idea. I truly think that we can use the data collected in order to <em>predict</em> the cryptocurrency market. I believe that we will be able to find trends that will signify a coin’s potential rise (and fall) a few hours before a spike or trough occurs.</p>
