This site contains my portfolio of projects from "Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis". The ideas presented below are currently conceptualized; however, I have hopes of implementing at least one of them.

### Abstract of Cryptocurrency With the World{-}

This project aims to utilize social media and other various news outlets to predict spikes and troughs of the cryptocurrency market. This data is aggregated together via various APIs and analyzed. The analysis is then conveyed to a user via text or email and a user can execute a trade via text or email. Eventually, the aim is to produce a bot to auto-trade cryptocurrencies.

### Abstract of Drone Monitoring {-}

Crime happens everyday and sometimes, officers respond too slowly due to a number of conditions. In this case, drones will allow officers to reach the scene of a crime before they physically arrive. Officers can pursue suspects, gather information, and survey the scene quicker and more efficiently than otherwise possible. Drones can then feed data back to the officer so they can analyze distance, images, and other key elements that could help solve a crime.

## About the author {-}

I'm Rahul and I'm currently a Senior Data Analyst/Data Engineer at a marketing company based in Los Angeles, CA. I received my bachelors degree from UC Berkeley in Applied Mathematics and shortly after did a brief stint in consulting. My background is actually rooted in theoretical mathematics; however, that has started shifting to more applied mathematics and data science. I am very interested in the cryptocurrency space, and am attempting to figure out a good way to utilize data science in the sector. Now, I'm back at UC Berkeley getting a Masters in Information and Data Science.
